# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: A job to say hello
    steps:
      - name: Hello world action step
        id: hello
        uses: sinha-debojyoti/Python-Syntax-Check-Action
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'Python'
      # Use the output from the `hello` step
      - name: Get the output time
        run: echo "The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}"
